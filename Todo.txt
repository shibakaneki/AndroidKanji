TODO List
---------		
o Implement the drawing area
	- Add a button usable to clear the user strokes
	- Add a button usable to verify the drawn strokes (hide it until version 2)
	- Add a button usable to replay the animation
	- Check the quality + performances
	- Adapt this view to the handset format
	- Interpolate curves
o Implement the kanji description view
	- Show some words using the selected kanji
o Define the design of the application (splash screen, controls, colors, icons, ...)
	- A kanji row should changes its background color when clicked
o Support the portait & landscape modes for tablets & handsets (tbd)
o Define a way to switch between views on handsets (static manager for the current kanji?)
o Improve the performances of the selection (it takes to much time)

Tests before production launch
------------------------------
o Add some favorites and verify that they remain after an application update

Ideas for later
---------------
o Drawing validation by checking the drawn strokes vs the kanjivg solution

Bugs
----
o Crash on exit
	- Seems related to the DrawingThread management.

To Add
