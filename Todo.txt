TODO List
---------
o Implement the add/remove to the favorite database
o Once the favorite table created, modify the ListView to have 2 columns (glyph|favorite) and make the favorite match the right star png
o Code the text filter

o Define the design of the application (splash screen, controls, colors, icons, ...)
o Show the animated SVG
o Add a kanji description view
o Add the drawing area

Backup Strategy
---------------
o When a new version of this app will be available, add an update method to backup the favorites
	o The idea is to check the DB version (in assest) and compare it to the db version (in sdcard). if sdcard version < asset version --> backup the favorites table,
		replace the sdcard table by the asset table and finally populate the favorite table with the backuped values. This check must be done at every launch if the
		kanji db is present on the sdcard folder.

Bugs
----
o The user is able to go on the splash screen Activity by pressing the 'back' button. He shouldn't be able to do it.
