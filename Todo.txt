TODO List
---------
o Create a script that generate my own sqlite db, based on kanjiVG & kanjiDic2
	- Create the db with all the required fields
	- use the created db in this Android application
	
o Implement the drawing area
	- Add a button usable to clear the user strokes
	- Add a button usable to verify the drawn strokes (hide it until version 2)
	- Add a button usable to replay the animation
	- Check the quality + performances
	- Adapt this view to the handset format
	- Interpolate curves

o Show the animated SVG
	- Compress all path with ZLib instead of qCompress and store them into the DB
	- Decompress the ZLib compressed datas from the DB
	- Send the SVG content to KanjiManager

o Implement the kanji description view
	- Get the yomi from the XML file and store them in a specific location in the DB

o Define the design of the application (splash screen, controls, colors, icons, ...)
o Support the portait & landscape modes for tablets & handsets (tbd)
o Define a way to switch between views on handsets (static manager for the current kanji?)

Tests before production launch
------------------------------
o Add some favorites and verify that they remain after an application update

Ideas for later
---------------
o Drawing validation by checking the drawn strokes vs the kanjivg solution
