TODO List
---------		
o Implement the drawing area
	- Add a button usable to clear the user strokes
	- Add a button usable to verify the drawn strokes (hide it until version 2)
	- Add a button usable to replay the animation
	- Check the quality + performances
	- Adapt this view to the handset format
	- Interpolate curves
o Implement the kanji description view
	- Add Bushu infos related to the selected bushu
o Define the design of the application (splash screen, controls, colors, icons, ...)
	- Create a splashscreen (japanese vector design maybe)
o Support the portait & landscape modes for tablets & handsets (tbd)
o Create a 'studied' list
	- Add this list in the filters
	- Act like the favorites but that will be the studied kanjis
	- For each jlpt list, display a stroke red to green related to the studied kanjis in order to show the progress

Tests before production launch
------------------------------
o Add some favorites and verify that they remain after an application update

Ideas for later
---------------
o Drawing validation by checking the drawn strokes vs the kanjivg solution

Bugs
----
o Crash on exit
	- Seems related to the DrawingThread management.
	
o Loss of favorite states
	- The Kanji state (in the ArrayList in the Adapter has not is favorite state updated. Only the star icon is updated. Due to that, when the device is shuts off its screen, the state is lost)

To Add
