Bugs
----
o Crash on exit
	- Seems related to the DrawingThread management.
	
o Loss of favorite states
	- The Kanji state (in the ArrayList in the Adapter has not is favorite state updated. Only the star icon is updated. Due to that, when the device is shuts off its screen, the state is lost)
	
o Drawing is difficult
	- Drawing on the SGS2 is difficult while it is easy to draw on the TF101
	
o Lines disappear
	- If we draw straight lines and make them go out of the border, they will disappear later.
